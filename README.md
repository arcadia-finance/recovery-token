# Arcadia Recovery Tokens

This repository contains the smart contracts for the Arcadia Recovery Tokens and Recovery Controller.

## Recovery Tokens

To ensure transparency and structure in the interim, the Arcadia Protocol LLC  will issue recovery tokens ("RecoveryTokens.sol") to affected users, representing the losses at a 1:1 to USD. The Recovery Tokens will facilitate transparent accounting and provide a structured method of documenting losses.

## Recovery Controller

The controller ("RecoveryController.sol"), an immutable smart contract, will handle the distribution and redemption of Recovery Tokens.

Please note that the Recovery Tokens are intended solely for purposes as described above and should not be used in any way which would not be in line with the above purposes.

*The issuance and distribution of Recovery Tokens, and/or the content of this communication or any future communication in the framework thereof, cannot be considered as a derogation of the terms of service (available on https://www.arcadia.finance/terms-of-service) and do not create any liability of the Arcadia Protocol LLC  or any of its affiliates.*
